Generate intermediate sequences for VFX processing using OIIO and
FFMPEG!

This module aims to help by providing helper classes and functions to: -
Get basic info from videos and images using iinfo and ffprobe as a
fallback. - Read and parse effect json outputted by
`AYON/Openpype <https://github.com/ynput>`__ for pipeline automation. -
Create a custom OCIO config file for direct use. - Create OIIO and
FFMPEG matrix values to be used in filters for repositioning. - Create
correctly formed OIIO commandline strings automatically. - Render out
frames with Color and Repositioning baked in using oiiotool

Instructions
------------

The core functionality relies on using **Processors** and **Operators**
to compute the correct commandline parameters.

**Operators** are single operation classes that hold your operation
parameters (translation, luts, cdls etc.)

**Processors** (usually classes such as ``ColorTransformProcessor``)
compute **Operators** chains together. They can be fed ordered lists of
dicts (with same name attributes as Operator classes) or ordered lists
of **Operators** objects, or one at a time for secondary processing
between the chained operations. On compute they return their relevant
section of commandline flags to be passed to oiio.

**Renderers** take care of returning the fully formed commanline command
and executing it.

Installation
------------

LabLib requires ``python-3.9`` and uses ``poetry`` for managing its
dependencies.

It’s encouraged to use the provided PowerShell script to install and
download the binaries for
`oiiotool <https://www.patreon.com/posts/openimageio-oiio-63609827>`__,
`ffmpeg <https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/7.0.1>`__,
the `OCIO Color
Configs <https://github.com/colour-science/OpenColorIO-Configs/releases/tag/v1.2>`__
and the font `Source Code
Pro <https://fontsource.org/fonts/source-code-pro>`__ which is used in
tests.

-  clone this repo
-  ``.\start.ps1 install``
-  ``.\start.ps1 get-dependencies``

Testing
~~~~~~~

You can run the full suite with ``.\start.ps1 test`` or to run custom
``pytest`` commands make sure to be in the cloned repository’s directory
and run ``poetry run pytest [ARGS]``.

Contributing
------------

The best way to contribute to LabLib currently is to write extensive
test cases for all modules. But also sharing your thoughts and ideas on
the `Discussions Page <https://github.com/ynput/LabLib/discussions>`__
really helps to keep this project going 💞
